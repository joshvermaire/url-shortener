# React + TypeScript + Vite

This usually works well to have Vite hot reload all your files but there seems to be an issue currently with Docker.

5.0.2 Cannot find module '@rollup/rollup-linux-arm64-gnu' on multi platform build

See https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/15167

I spent a long time trying to get it to work and was unable to.
