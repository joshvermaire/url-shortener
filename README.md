# ShortUrl Generation Service
This is a docker container which I thought could be published straight to Docker Hub but I see I have to create individual images instead of just a single container. 2 of the services (the node.js services) are images but the remainder aren't. I will need to do modify them.

In the meantime, feel free to pull the full container. I have it running on localhost:8080 with nginx handling all the routing.
